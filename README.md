# Course Project: Automated Fact Checking
Coursework for COMP0084 Information Retrieval and Data Mining
University College London, 2019

## Project Description
This project aims at exploiting information retrieval and data mining methods
to assess the veracity of claims made online. At its core, the project consists
of three steps:
- relevant document retrieval
- evidence sentence selection
- claim veracity prediction

The dataset used is the publicly available Fact Extraction and Verification 
(FEVER) dataset. The data is available in the following ways:
- `train.jsonl`: labeled training dataset
- `shared_task_dev.jsonl`: labeled development dataset
- `shared_task_dev_public.jsonl`: unlabeled development dataset
- `shared_task_test.jsonl`: unlabeled testing dataset
